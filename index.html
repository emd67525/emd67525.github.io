<H4> Additional Information About Me </H4>
<p> I am a hardworking student currently attending the University of Georgia. I am self-sufficient, an active listener, organized, positive, detail-oriented, and approachable. I am a sophomore transfer from the University of Mississippi, where I attended the Honors College with an intended Biology major. I recently decided to switch my major to Finance. I work extremely hard inside the classroom which is reflected in my GPA. I take my education very seriously and hope to apply my skills to the real business world post-graduation. I plan to graduate in <mark> the spring of 2020</mark>. The University of Georgia has better prepared me and given me countless opportunities to further explore the business world. I have a passion for design as well, and my internship this summer will assist me in developing a deeper understanding of the field. I will be traveling to conferences and client's homes from Georgia to Tennessee, and I am extremely excited to apply my hardworking techniques to my internship this summer.</p>
